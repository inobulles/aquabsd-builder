Say hello to Bob the builder ðŸ‘·

Bob the builder will help you create aquaBSD installer images.

## Usage

Bob the builder always enjoys giving a hand!
Don't be afraid to ask him to build an installer image by invoking him:

```shell
% sh bob.sh
```

He'll fetch the required resources to build your image if you don't already have them under `dist/`.
