# `src`

The files in this directory come straight from [`aquabsd-core`](https://github.com/inobulles/aquabsd-core).
Some of these files from the aquaBSD core source are needed which are not included in either of the distributions.
They are copied and kept up to date here in the interest of not having to download the whole source each time the core version is updated.
